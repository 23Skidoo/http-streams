    Explore with a simple HTTP request against localhost (where we

    sophisticated once we start writing real tests.

{-
    One of the deisgn features of io-streams is their use of the
    standard IO monad exception handling facilities. This example
    doesn't do much yet, but shows the basic usage pattern. Presumably
    the resulant ByteString (in this case) bubbling out of doStuff would
    be returned to the calling program to then be put to some use.

resource = bracket

    (closeConnection)
    (doStuff)


-- Now actually use the supplied Connection object to further
-- exercise the API. We'll do a PUT this time.

doStuff c = do
    q <- buildRequest $ do
        http PUT "/item/56"

    p <- sendRequest2 c q (\o ->
        Streams.write (Just "Hello") o)
    
    _ <- receiveResponse c

    putStrLn $ show c
    putStrLn $ show q
    putStrLn $ show p
    putStrLn ""
    return $ S.pack "TODO"

{-
    Experiment with a convenience API. This is very much in flux,
    with the open question being what type to return; since there's
    no Connection object here (its use being wrapped) we possibly want
    to run the entire Stream into memory. Or, we could a handler?
