{-
    One of the deisgn features of io-streams is their use of the
    standard IO monad exception handling facilities. This example
    doesn't do much yet, but shows the basic usage pattern. Presumably
    the resulant ByteString (in this case) bubbling out of doStuff would
    be returned to the calling program to then be put to some use.

    Experiment with a convenience API. This is very much in flux,
    with the open question being what type to return, if any.
