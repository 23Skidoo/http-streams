    This is a String because that's what the uri package works in. There
    was a fairly detailed disucssion on haskell-cafe about this, with
    the conclusion that URLs are composed of characters, not octets.

-- | Open a connection to webserver.
--
-- Usage is as follows:
--
-- > c <- openConnection "localhost" 80
-- > ...
--
-- More properly, you'd use 'bracket' to wrap the call; see
-- 'closeConnection' for an example.

-- | Having composed a 'Request' object with the headers and metadata for
-- this connection, you can now send the request to the server, along
-- with the entity body, if there is one. For the rather common case of
-- HTTP requests like GET that don't send data, use 'emptyBody' as the
-- output stream:
--
-- > e <- emptyBody
-- > p <- sendRequest c q e
--
sendRequest :: Connection -> Request -> OutputStream ByteString -> IO (Response)
sendRequest _ _ _ = return $ Response

--
-- | Handle the response coming back from the server. This function
-- returns you the 'InputStream' containing the entity body.
--
-- For example, if you just wanted to print the response body:
--
-- > b <- receiveResponse c
-- >
-- > m <- Stream.read b
-- > case m of
-- >     Just bytes -> putStrLn bytes
-- >     Nothing    -> return ()
--
-- Obviously, you can do more sophisticated things with the
-- 'InputStream', which is the whole point of having an @io-streams@
-- based HTTP client library.
--
receiveResponse :: Connection -> IO (InputStream ByteString)
receiveResponse _ = stub
  where
    stub = nullInput

{-
    Is there a way we can make this static and so be reusable by
    everyone, rather than an IO action?

emptyBody :: IO (OutputStream ByteString)
emptyBody = nullOutput

--
-- | Shutdown the connection. You need to call this release the
-- underlying socket file descriptor and related network resources. To
-- do so reliably, use this in conjunction with 'openConnection' in a
-- call to 'bracket':
--
-- > --
-- > -- Make connection, cleaning up afterward
-- > --
-- >
-- > foo :: IO ByteString
-- > foo = bracket
-- >    (openConnection "localhost" 80)
-- >    (closeConnection)
-- >    (doStuff)
-- >
-- > --
-- > -- Actually use Connection to send Request and receive Response
-- > --
-- >
-- > doStuff :: Connection -> IO ByteString
--
-- While returning a ByteString is probably the most common use case,
-- you could conceivably do more processing of the response in 'doStuff'
-- and have it and 'foo' return a different type.

closeConnection :: Connection -> IO ()
closeConnection c = do
    close s
