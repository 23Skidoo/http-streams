-- | Having composed a 'Request' object with the headers and metadata for
-- this connection, you can now send the request to the server, along
-- with the entity body, if there is one. For the rather common case of
-- HTTP requests like GET that don't send data, use 'emptyBody' as the
-- output stream:
--
-- > e <- emptyBody
-- > p <- sendRequest c q e
--
sendRequest :: Connection -> Request -> OutputStream ByteString -> IO (Response)
sendRequest _ _ _ = return $ Response

--
-- | Handle the response coming back from the server. This function
-- returns you the 'OutputStream' containing the entity body.
--
-- For example, if you just wanted to print the response body:
--
-- > b <- receiveResponse c
-- >
-- > m <- Stream.read b
-- > case m of
-- >     Just bytes -> putStrLn bytes
-- >     Nothing    -> return ()
--
-- Obviously, you can do more sophisticated things with the
-- 'OutputStream', which is the whole point of having an @io-streams@
-- based HTTP client library.

    Is there a way we can make this static and so be reusable by
